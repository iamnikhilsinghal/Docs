1. CHECK VERSIONS (if installed):
nodejs -v
npm -v

2. INSTALL OTHERWISE:
sudo apt install nodejs
sudo apt install npm

3. INSTALL ANGULAR:
sudo npm install -g #angular/cli

4. CHECK ANGULAR VERSION:
ng --version

--OPTIONAL--
IF ANGULAR shows node version is old:
sudo npm cache clean -f
sudo npm install -g n
sudo n stable

5. CREATE NEW ANGULAR APPLICATION:		
ng new shekher-angular

6. To start your application:(by default start at localhost:4200)
ng serve -o 		OR 			npm start (as described in package.json)
note: to free a port if already used: sudo fuser -k 4200/tcp

7. To open app in VS code:
code .

8. In VS code, imp files:
a. The e2e folder is for end to end testing.
b. node_modules is a folder you will never watch to touch, as it contains the project's dependencies.
c. /src contains much of your code.
d. /app is where you will spend the most of your time writing your Angular 8 code. It includes the routing, components, and more.
e. /index.html is the entry point to the app, and you generally don't touch this file.
f. /styles.scss is where your global CSS rulesets will reside.

9. COMPONENT:
The fundamental building blocks of your Angular app are the components. Components consist of 3 elements:
a. The imports
b. The component decorator, which are various properties for your component. The component decorator includes locations to your component's template and CSS location.
c. The component logic, where your code resides.

10. app
a. component.html: UI
b. component.ts: logic

11. TO CREATE A NEW COMPONENT:
ng generate component home
ng generate component list
