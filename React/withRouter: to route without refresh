import { withRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
this.props.history.push('/createSalesQuotations');
export default withRouter(SalesOverview);


this.props.history.push pushes to new page programatically without using Link.

withRouter is used to provide wouting related props(like history, location etc) 
where this component is going to be used

Absolute Paths : to="/some-path"  or to="some-path" -> lead to example.com/some-path 

Relative Paths : If you're on a component loaded via /posts , 
to="new"  would lead to example.com/new , NOT example.com/posts/new -> 
<Link to={props.match.url + '/new'}>  will lead to example.com/posts/new
